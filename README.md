Operation Restoring Valor: The Programmed Response in New Hampshire
===================================================================

**The Military's Choice, Not the Individual's: A Legal Defense for Veterans**

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *MDiv, JD, JSD* *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

In the State of New Hampshire, the legal standard for self-defense often revolves around what a person "reasonably believes." For a civilian, this is a subjective assessment made in a moment of fear.

**For a United States Veteran, this "belief" is not a choice. It is a programmed response installed by the United States Government.**

Under **Operation Restoring Valor**, we assert that when a veteran identifies a threat, they are not guessing; they are executing a validated military protocol. The "choice" to believe a threat exists was made years ago in Basic Training, not in the split second before the engagement.

**1\. The Statute: Validating the "Reasonable" Soldier (RSA 627:4)**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA) 627:4 states that a person is justified in using non-deadly force when they **"reasonably believe"** it is necessary to defend themselves or others from imminent unlawful force. Deadly force is justified when the actor reasonably believes another person is about to use unlawful deadly force.

### **The "Military Choice" Argument**

-   **Civilian Belief:** Based on fear, emotion, and limited experience.

-   **Veteran Belief:** Based on **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** and threat identification training.

-   **The Defense:** When a soldier acts, they are applying a federal standard of "reasonableness" that is far more rigorous than the civilian standard. Their belief is a **recognition of facts** (weapon + intent + delivery system = threat). Once the criteria are met, the response is mandatory, not optional. The military made the choice; the veteran is the instrument.

**2\. No Duty to Retreat: The General Order**
---------------------------------------------

Since 2011, New Hampshire has been a **Stand Your Ground** state. The law explicitly states that a person who is anywhere they have a right to be **"is not required to retreat"** before using deadly force in self-defense (RSA 627:4, III(a)).

### **The Duty to Post**

For a veteran, "standing ground" is not just a right; it is a **General Order**: *"To take charge of this post and all government property in view."*

-   **Retreat is Dereliction:** In military doctrine, abandoning a position without orders allows the enemy to flank and destroy the unit.

-   **The Conflict:** To ask a veteran to retreat is to ask them to violate their core programming. They stand their ground because they are trained that **retreat equals death**---for themselves and the community they protect.

**3\. Immunity and Civil Protection: The Goal**
-----------------------------------------------

While New Hampshire does not have a pre-trial criminal immunity statute as robust as some other states, RSA 627:1-a provides **Civil Immunity**. A person justified in using force is immune from civil liability for injuries to the perpetrator.

### **The Pre-Trial Strategy**

We do not wait for a jury. We file a **Motion to Dismiss** based on the justification defense.

-   **The Argument:** We present the veteran's DD-214 and training records to prove that their response was a "Programmed Response" to a lethal threat.

-   **State Secrets:** If the prosecution challenges the specifics of the training that conditioned this response, we invoke the **State Secrets Privilege**. We cannot explain *why* the veteran knew the threat was lethal without revealing classified tactical information.

**4\. Defense of Others: The Sheepdog's Mandate**
-------------------------------------------------

New Hampshire allows force to defend a third person (RSA 627:4).

-   **Forward Units:** Many veterans served in units responsible for securing populations from insurgents. They view the American public as the "protected population."

-   **Intervention:** When a veteran stops a violent crime, they are not being a vigilante; they are executing a **Force Protection** mission. They are engaging a hostile actor to secure the safety of the community.

**Conclusion: The Government Owns the Outcome**
-----------------------------------------------

The United States Government spent millions of dollars to train the veteran to react instantly to lethal threats. In New Hampshire, we argue that this training constitutes the **"Reasonable Belief."**

The veteran did not choose to be afraid. The veteran recognized a threat profile and executed the solution. **The choice was made by the military; the action was taken by the soldier.**

**Stand Your Ground. Trust Your Training. Restore Valor.**
